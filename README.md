# doomlike-gl
Making a doomlike game (base code from my other repository, learning-opengl)
To build with the makefile as-is, a folder named include must be added to the same directory. Header dependencies can be placed there. Dependancies are GLEW and GLFW3; stb_image.h is also a dependancy but is included in the repo.
